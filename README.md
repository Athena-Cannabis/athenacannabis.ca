# Athena Cannabis Website

Source code for the Athena Cannabis website.

This site is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and a host of other open source tools.

The project is a front end application for a [Woocommerce store](https://woocommerce.com) back end. Actual product information data will come from [TechPOS](https://www.techpos.ca/).

## Live Site

The site can be found at [athenacannabis.ca](https://athenacannabis.ca).

## Customer Issues

If you are having customer service issues, please contact the store directly. A contact form exists on the site which you can fill out or you could email [hello@athenacannabis.ca].

Please do not create GitHub issues for customer service related issues.

## Contributing

 Thank you so much for your time! We love contributers and will excitedly accept any contributions to advance the project. 
 
 Please feel free to create a pull request or github issue. In time we'll add templates for these things, but for now just use your best judgement on what information needs to be included.

### Security related concerns

If you identify any security related concerns, please contact @neilmispelaar directly. Please do not create a GitHub issue for these items.

## Branch Management

### Main 

The `main` branch is built and deployed to the live site ([athenacannabis.ca](https://athenacannabis.ca)) using Netlify's brilliant integration. 

This branch holds the current production version of the site. 

### Development

The `development` branch will be the main line to house the code for the new functionality.

We're investigating using Netlify's deploy previews for testing features and development. 

This branch may be deployed to ([next.athenacannabis.ca](https://next.athenacannabis.ca)) in the future.

The current major development project is adding shop functionality (products / carts / checkout).

## Project setup

### Compiles and minifies for production

## Why open source

Why not? The rationale here is that the store will be built leveraging open source software, so it's an opportunity to give back to the community. Hopefully in the future someone, somewhere, will be able to use this code to setup their own front end implementation.

Furthermore, if someone spots an issue, error or opportunity, open sourcing the code creates an opportunity for the community to comment on the code base, and possibly offering their own contributions.
