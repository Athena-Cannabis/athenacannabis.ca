# Athena Cannabis Website

Source code for the Athena Cannabis website.

This site is built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and a host of other open source tools.

The project will develop into a front end for a [Shopify store](https://www.shopify.ca/) using their [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api) as the back end.

## Live Site

The site can be found at [athenacannabis.ca](https://athenacannabis.ca).

## Customer Issues

If you are having customer service issues, please contact the store directly. In time, a contact us page will be added to the site which will provide the vehicles for contacting the store.

Please do not create GitHub issues for customer service related issues.

## Why open source

Why not? The rationale here is that the store will be built leveraging open source software, so it's an opportunity to give back to the community. Hopefully in the future someone, somewhere, will be able to use this code to setup their own front end implementation.

Furthermore, if someone spots an issue, error or opportunity, open sourcing the code creates an opportunity for the community to comment on the code base, and possibly offering their own contributions.
